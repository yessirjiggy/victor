    <h1>Simple Git Practice</h1>
    <p>
        I am learning Git and Github at vsasf Tech ICT Academy, Enugu. <br>
        I learnt how to create html files using git and edit the file content using 
        vs code text editor.
    </p> 
    <p>
        learning git which is a version control system is very interesting. <br>
       Today I learnt how to push my local repo to remote repo using github. <br>
       Git and Github are so much easy to learn and work with.
